                    <h2>The Dodo</h2>
                    <p>The Dodo was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It became extinct in the late 17th century due to human activities such as hunting and the introduction of invasive species. The Dodo is often used as a symbol of extinct species.</p>
